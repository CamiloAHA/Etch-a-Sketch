# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project for a browser version of a sketchpad with an option to select multiple colors, 
erase or clear the grid.

This is the first advance project for my github portfolio. At the end of this project I expect 
to dominate DOM manipulation skills in conjunction with CSS style and grid utilities.
